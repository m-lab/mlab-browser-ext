Here's how to install:

1. Follow the instructions to download/install the Mozilla
Add-On SDK: [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation)

2. Clone this repo. 

3. From that repo directory, run 
`cfx xpi`
which will generate an xpi that you can install into the browser.

Protip: Use the Extension Autoinstaller plugin. See 'Developing 
without cfx run' on 
[this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Getting_started)
